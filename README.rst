Python logging library to emit JSON logs in a SAP CloudFoundry environment.
===========================================================================

This is a collection of support libraries for Python applications running on Cloud Foundry that
serve two main purposes: provide (a) means to emit structured application log messages and (b)
instrument web applications of your application stack to collect request metrics.

For details on the concepts and log formats, please look at the sibling project for `java logging
support <https://github.com/SAP/cf-java-logging-support>`__.


Features
-----------

1. Lightweight, no dependencies. Support of Python 2.7 & 3.5.
2. Compatible with the Python **logging** module. Minimal configuration needed.
3. Emits JSON logs (`format
   details <https://github.com/SAP/cf-java-logging-support/tree/master/cf-java-logging-support-core/beats>`__).
4. Supports **correlation-id**.
5. Supports request instrumentation. Built in support for `Flask 0.1x <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`__ &
   `Sanic 0.5.x <https://github.com/channelcat/sanic>`__. Extensible to support others.
6. Includes CF-specific information (space id, app id, etc.) to logs.
7. Supports adding extra properties to JSON log object.

Installation
------------

Install the package with pip:

::

    pip install sap_cf_logging

Usage
-----

Setting up your application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Logging library needs to be initialized. Depending on you application type, different initialization
is used. You should usually do this in your application entrypoint.

For CLI applications you just need to call ``cf_logging.init()`` *once* to configure the library.
The library will try to configure future loggers to emit logs in JSON format.

If you are using one of the supported frameworks, check the `Configuration <#configuration>`__
section to see how to configure it.

**Setting up the CloudFoundry environment**

In order for your logs to appear in the Kibana dashboard, you have to create an **application-logs**
service instance and bind it to your application.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installation use the following guide to configure the Python cf logging library.

Flask
^^^^^

First import the ``cf_logging`` library and setup Flask logging on the application.

.. code:: python

    from sap.cf_logging import flask_logging

    app = flask.Flask(__name__)
    flask_logging.init(app, logging.INFO)

Next use Pythonâ€™s logging library

.. code:: python

    @app.route('/')
    def root_route():
        logger = logging.getLogger('my.logger')
        logger.info('Hi')

        return 'ok'

Note the logs generated by the application

Sanic
^^^^^

.. code:: python

    import sanic
    import logging

    from sanic.response import HTTPResponse
    from sap.cf_logging import sanic_logging
    from sap.cf_logging.core.constants import REQUEST_KEY,

    app = sanic.Sanic('test.cf_logging')
    sanic_logging.init(app)

    @app.route('/')
    async def two(request):
        extra = {REQUEST_KEY: request}
        logging.getLogger('my.logger').debug('Hi', extra = extra)
        return HTTPResponse(body='ok')

**Note**: With Sanic you need to pass the request with an ``extra`` parameter in the logging API.
This is needed in order to get the *correlation_id* generated at the beginning of the request or
fetched from the HTTP headers.

General
^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    import logging
    from sap import cf_logging

    cf_logging.init()

    logger = logging.getLogger("cli.logger")
    logger.info('hi')

**Notes**: - All loggers set up and created before the initialization of the Cloud Foundry logging library will
be left untouched. - When using Flask and Sanic with the logging library a before and
after request middleware is attached, and it will capture response times for each request.
